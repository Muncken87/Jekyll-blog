This build have been heavily focused on Posion damage(90% of my dps). I have ben able to get insanly high posion damage by focusing on stats that "double dip" on damage. This is done by using trap and Firestorm together with full chaos conversion, focusing on Trap and Chaos damage and using four more multiplier support gems which also double dips, resulting in insane damage.
